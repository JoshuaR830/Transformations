# Transformations
This is a project I did for my A-Levels, I created it for a maths teacher. The program can do different transformations and makes it easier to teach students.

Just run the python program to get started. The resources are stored in the other folders. 

When you open the program you are greeted with a dashboard, you can chose to create new groups allows you to save settings for a specific student group so that you can quickly pick up where you left off. You can also go to another section that allows you to create shapes to transform by clicking on a grid to put squares down in different patterns. 

If you have finished with the shapes or groups you can go to another section to delete them.

The main section in this is where everything is brought together. You can perform translations, reflections and rotations. There are many options including a difficulty slider, and options to toggle what to show. Not only that but you can also change additional settings to make things even more fun.

If you want to use this program I suggest playing around with it and getting to now it well.

Enjoy!
